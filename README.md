# 109 Python Problems for CCPS 109

This repository contains the problem specifications, the automated tester and the necessary data files for the graded lab problems for the course *CCPS 109 Computer Science I*, as taught by [Ilkka Kokkarinen](http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~ikokkari/) for the Chang School of Continuing Education, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada.

Write all your functions one by one into the same file `labs109.py` so that the acceptance tester script `tester109.py` can find them. This tester will execute the automated acceptance tests precisely for the functions implemented in `labs109.py`. The acceptance tester gices each implemented function a large number of pseudorandomly generated test cases, and a checksum is computed from the returned answers. This checksum is then compared to the checksum computed from the instructor's private model solution. The function passes the acceptance test if and only if these two checksums are identical and the function produced its results in a reasonable time.

This setup allows students to work at home at their convenience, and to know at all times whether their functions are correct just by running the acceptance test script. This automation eliminates basically all any additional labour needed from the the human instructor or the TA's, who can concentrate on helping students debug their solutions that fail the acceptance tests. Once students have given each problem a good old "college try" (including at least one night of sleeping over it to look at the problem with fresh eyes the next day) but still haven't been able to untangle themselves from that knot, they can contact the course personnel for help to get loose again. 

In addition to the precomputed checksums that serve as the definitive acceptance tests for each function, the file `expected_answers` contains the expected results for the first 300 test cases for each problem. The acceptance tester will compare these to the results produced by the student solution in lockstep. At the first discrepancy, the test for that function is immediately terminated, and the test case arguments, the expected correct result and the returned incorrect result are displayed as a valuable debugging aid. Having a reasonably short but explicit test case available is an invaluable aid in debugging a function that does not pass the automated test.

Everyone teaching or learning Python is welcome to use, adapt and distribute these problems and the associated acceptance tester for their own purposes as they see fit. The author welcomes feedback by email at `ilkka.kokkarinen@gmail.com` from computer science instructors who use these problems in their courses.
